# Lab 2: Simple Input, Output and Arithmetics

## Synopsis
In this exercise, we are going to explore the standard input and output streams in C++ to get data in and out of our program, declare variables and do arithmetics.

## Problem 1 - hello
Write a program that prompts the user to enter his/her name and then prints a greeting on the standard output.

## Problem 2 - calcall
Write a program that reads two numbers from the standard input and then prints the result of the four primary arithmetic operations with those two numbers to the standard output: addition, substraction, multiplication and division. Try using `int` and `float` as the type of the variables.

## Problem 3 - area
Write a program that reads a triangle by 3 sides from the standard input and then prints the area of the triangle to the standard output. Use the Heron formula to calculate the area.
