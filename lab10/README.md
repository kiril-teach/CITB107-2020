# Lab 10: Vectors II

## Synopsis
In this exercise, we will combine the concepts of classes and vectors for a more elegant solution to the `grades` problem from Lab 8.

## Problem  - grades
Copy the program from lab 8 and modify it to calculate the average of all students. For each student, use the average of all his courses.
* Sum and average calculations are contained withing functions, not all over the place.
* Divide the program in sections: read input, calculate/logic, output
* Read course information into an object of class `Course`
* Use vector to first read all student's courses before filtering (findingand calculating the average.
* Write tests using `assert` for sum and average, as well as parsing the course line.
