# Lab 3: Conditional Statements
## Synopsis
We are going to learn what are conditional statements in general and how to use them in C++ to control the flow of a program. By constructing complex logical expressions and using boolean variables, we will make our previous programs more robust.

In addition, we will explore VS Code a bit more, learn how to configure it to compile and run our actively open file.

## Problem - area
Take the program for computing the area by 3 sides from exercise #2 and enter 1 2 and 5. What do you see? 

Modify the program to validate the user input by checking if such a triangle exists. Print an error message to the standard output if it doesn't and terminate the program with a non-zero exit code. Otherwise, keep the logic as is.

Try different ways to construct the conditional statement, e.g. a single expression in the brackets, a variable, a few variables, apply DeMorgan's Theory, etc.
