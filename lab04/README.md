# Lab 4: Simple Loops
## Synopsis
We are going to learn how to combine conditional statements and loops to solve problems that require series of steps to be executed multiple times. We are going to use a [greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) to solve a simple problem.

## Problem - change
Write a program that reads amount paid and amount due (e.g. vending machine software) and outputs what is the change and how to return it (i.e. number of each currency unit) to the standard output.

Don't forget to validate the user input and terminate the program with a non-zero exit code.
