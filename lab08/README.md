# Lab 8: Advanced Program Flow

## Synopsis
In this exercise, we will apply loops, functions, conditional statements and input/output to solve a more complicated problem.

## Problem - grades
Write a program that calculates the average grade for a course, by first calculating each student's average result for that course and the combining the results in a total average. 
 * The program should have a database (csv files in a folder) of students' grades per course. Each student should have a separate file named with his faculty number and has an artbitrary number of grades per each course.
 * The program should read the course signature (e.g CITB107) and then a list of student faculty numbers until the end of the standard input stream (e.g. CTRL+D) and output the average of all students for this course.
