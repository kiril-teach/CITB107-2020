# Lab 7: Classes

## Synopsis
In this exercise, we introduce the concept of objects and classes: how to structure our program using classes and how to write simple classes with state and behaviour.

## Problem - expr
Write a program that uses an `Expression` class to solve the problem of `calc` program from __Lab 6__. The main function should pass a hardcoded string to the `Expression` class, validate that the expression is valid and print the result.
