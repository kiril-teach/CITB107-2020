# Lab 5: Interactive Programs
## Synopsis
Practice everything you've learned so far - input/output, arithmetics, conditional statements and loops - by creating an interactive program.

We will also explore working with string streams and introduce the concept of functions for structuring our code.

## Problem - calc
Write a program that reads simple arithmetic expressions from the standard input stream, evaluates them and prints the result in the standard output. If there is a problem with the expression, the program should print an error message in the standard error stream.

The program should recognize the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` and support only two operand expressions, i.e. `x ? y`.

Example input:
```
5+3
10.4-15
3*4
12/6
```
